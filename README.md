#Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client, known as The Gaming Room, was a company specializing in mobile app game development. They had previously achieved success by launching a puzzle competition game on the Android platform. Their goal was to expand their game's reach and accessibility by creating a web-based version of their existing Android app. The client required a software solution that would allow their game to be played on various platforms and devices, not just limited to Android. This involved designing a web-based application that would replicate the gameplay and features of their existing mobile app, enabling users to enjoy the game on desktop computers, laptops, and other devices with internet access.

#What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

In developing this documentation, I excelled at providing a well-structured and thorough recommendation section for the client. I covered essential aspects that the client needed to consider, such as the host operating system (OS), memory and storage management solutions on host servers, the API framework, security measures, and the advantages of utilizing serverless architecture for launching their product. I also presented a compelling case for why a cloud platform would be the most suitable choice for the client's needs and goals. By explaining the benefits and advantages of leveraging cloud technology, I provided a clear rationale for why it would be beneficial for the client to adopt this approach.

#What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

When working through a design document, I found that the process of analyzing the domain model depicted as a UML class diagram was particularly helpful in guiding the development of the code. By studying the diagram, I gained a clear understanding of the structure of the application and the relationships between various components of the app.

#If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I were to revise one part of my work on these documents, I would focus on improving the evaluation section that compares and contrasts popular operating systems (such as Mac, Windows, and Linux) and mobile platforms. Specifically, I would delve deeper into the nuances between these platforms on the client side. By delving deeper into these nuances, I could provide more valuable and actionable information for the client. This would enable them to make informed decisions regarding the selection of operating systems and browsers for their web-based solution, ensuring optimal compatibility, performance, and user experience across different platforms.

#How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Understanding and incorporating the user's needs into software design is crucial for creating a successful and user-friendly application. One of the user's needs that I implemented was reliability. Reliability is crucial because users rely on the application to perform their tasks or achieve their goals. They need to trust that the software will consistently deliver the expected results and that their data will be handled securely. Considering the user's needs during design is vital because they are the ultimate consumers of the product. Their satisfaction and positive experience directly impact the success of the client.

#How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

When approaching software design, I followed a systematic approach. I began by gathering requirements and understanding the client's objectives. Then, I broke down those objectives into specific functional requirements and further refined them into technical requirements. By leveraging iterative development, I designed and implemented the software, ensuring to incorporate user-centric design principles. In the future, I would continue to employ these techniques, and also emphasize effective communication and collaboration,
